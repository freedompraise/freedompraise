### Meet Praise Freedom Dike. I am a young software developer actively looking for a junior dev role and open source projects to. 
Unfortunately, I do not spend as much time on platforms; most of my time is spent learning and coding and working on projects. 
This narrative will soon be changed, hopefully, lol.
